messages.clj is in need of a rewrite.

A message will be a record, with fields for user, host, command, args, trailing args, and the original string message as it was received.

The current mess of parsing functions should be simplified into 3:
	* parse-prefix, which will return the username, realname and host as a list. These strings will be empty if there is no prefix.
	* parse-command, which will return the command as a one element list.
	* parse-args, which will return a list containing a list of all of the normal arguments of a command as the first element, and the trailing argument (if any) of the command as the second.

str->msg is then as simple as (apply Message. (concat (parse-prefix msg) ...))

core.clj:
The bot-loop thread should be interrupted before the socket is closed.

Re-examine the way the thread shuts down. What is the best way to close it down from the REPL? with all-done in the finally block, we'll hit all-done twice if we run it from the REPL. Once when you call it yourself, and the again as the bot-loop thread hits an exeption (currently because the socket gets closed while it's waiting for I/O) and runs the finally block. Address this.

core.clj:
The user, server, and client-info maps should be moved to their own files and :use'd. They should probably be records instead of maps, too.

What do we want client-info to contain? It shouldn't have channel, as the bot can be in many channels at once. This is best handled inside (def-response "PRIVMSG" ...), where we find the source of the message and reply there. 

Connecting to the server should allow you specify a list of channels to join.

(defn connect [conn client-info & channels]
  ...
  (doseq [channel channels]
         (join conn channel)))

plugins.clj:
Implement plugins. This file, when included, should include every file in cljbot/plugins/*. A macro similar to def-response will create a hook in. The bot will have a prefix, say '~', which (def-response "PRIVMSG") will look for. It will then use a multimethod to select the correct hook-in specified by the message.

Example: "~foo" will cause plugin "foo" to be run.

Now, the problem with this is that there might not be a convenient syntax for factoids, should they be implemented. Here are two solutions for this:

1) Write factoids as a plugin. Usage would look like this: "~fact foo" will cause cljbot to respond with the "foo" factoid.
2) Have a separate prefix for the factoids. That way, "~foo" will call the foo plugin, but "!foo" will respond with the foo factoid.

Solution #2 is preferred.

Configuration:
Eventually, I would like to distribute cljbot as a leiningen uberjar. This means some sort of configuration file will need to be created. For simplicity, some JSON or XML based file would be preferred. 

However, distributing as a .jar would create a problem: currently, cljbot is mostly controlled directly via the REPL. distributing as a .jar would mean creating some other interface to the bot - either by packaging the repl and dropping to it inside the app once bot-thread has been launched, or some other mechanism.
